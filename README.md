# PySecScripts üõ°Ô∏è

Welcome to **PySecScripts**, a curated collection of Python scripts designed for security testing and penetration testing. This repository serves as a showcase of my expertise in developing automated tools that enhance network defense capabilities and streamline security assessments. It's ideal for cybersecurity enthusiasts and professionals seeking to deepen their understanding and application of security practices through Python.

## Current Projects üìÇ

### SSH Brute Force Script
- **Description**: This script automates the process of attempting to log into an SSH server using a list of common passwords. It is intended to help identify weak passwords and demonstrate the importance of robust security policies in SSH environments.

### SHA-256 Hash Cracker Tool
- **Description**: This tool is designed to perform brute-force attacks against SHA-256 hashed passwords to identify the plaintext password from a hashed version using a common wordlist. It highlights the importance of robust encryption methods and the risks associated with weak cryptographic practices.

### Username and Password Brute Forcer Tool
- **Description**: This Python script automates testing common usernames and passwords against web-based login forms to detect weak credentials. It demonstrates the ease with which common credentials can be exploited and underscores the need for stronger authentication mechanisms.
