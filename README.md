## Current Projects üìÇ

### SSH Brute Force Script
- **Description**: Automates attempts to log into an SSH server using a list of common passwords. This tool helps in identifying weak passwords, demonstrating the necessity for robust SSH security policies.

### SHA-256 Hash Cracker Tool
- **Description**: Performs brute-force attacks against SHA-256 hashed passwords, attempting to reveal the plaintext password using a common wordlist. This highlights the importance of robust cryptographic practices and the vulnerabilities posed by weak encryption.

### Username and Password Brute Forcer Tool
- **Description**: Automates testing of common usernames and passwords against web-based login forms to detect weak credentials. This underscores the need for strong authentication and demonstrates how easily common credentials can be exploited.
