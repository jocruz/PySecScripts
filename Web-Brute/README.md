# PySecScripts üõ°Ô∏è

Welcome to **PySecScripts**, a curated collection of Python scripts designed for security testing and penetration testing. This repository showcases my expertise in developing automated tools that enhance network defense capabilities and streamline security assessments. Ideal for cybersecurity enthusiasts and professionals, these scripts aim to deepen understanding and application of security practices through Python.

## Current Projects üìÇ

### SSH Brute Force Script
- **Description**: Automates the process of attempting to log into an SSH server using a list of common passwords, highlighting the importance of robust security policies in SSH environments.

### SHA-256 Hash Cracker Tool
- **Description**: Performs brute-force attacks against SHA-256 hashed passwords, identifying plaintext passwords from hashed versions using a common wordlist.

### Username and Password Brute Forcer Tool
- **Description**: Tests common usernames and passwords against web-based login forms, detecting weak credentials and underscoring the need for stronger authentication mechanisms.

## OWASP Top 10 and Script Relevance üåç
The scripts in this repository address several of the OWASP Top 10 security risks, such as:
- **Injection (SQL Injection Tester)**: Tests for vulnerabilities in web applications that could allow unauthorized data access.
- **Broken Authentication (Username and Password Brute Forcer Tool)**: Demonstrates the risks associated with weak authentication mechanisms and promotes stronger security practices.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure (SHA-256 Hash Cracker Tool)**: Highlights the risks of poor cryptographic practices and encourages the use of robust encryption methods.

These scripts serve as practical tools to understand, test, and mitigate a range of security vulnerabilities aligned with the OWASP Top 10.

## What is Cybersecurity? üîê
Cybersecurity involves protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks typically aim to access, alter, or destroy sensitive information; extort money from users; or interrupt normal business processes.

## Role of Python in Cybersecurity üêç
Python is a powerful tool in the field of cybersecurity due to its simplicity and readability, which allow for rapid development and deployment of security tools. Its extensive library ecosystem supports tasks ranging from penetration testing and network scanning to malware analysis and automated reporting.

## Using the Scripts ‚öôÔ∏è
Each script in this repository is documented within its own directory in a `README.md` file. These instructions provide detailed guidance on configuration and execution to ensure you can effectively use each tool.

## Conclusion üèÅ
These Python scripts not only offer practical insights into common vulnerabilities but also reinforce the necessity of continuous security improvements and the importance of adhering to established security standards like the OWASP Top 10. They are an essential part of any cybersecurity professional's toolkit, aiding in both educational and practical applications to safeguard digital assets.
